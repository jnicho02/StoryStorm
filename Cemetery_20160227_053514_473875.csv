From the log house, go west and angle slightly north, cross Sandy Creek, and then cross a barbed wire fence, and you will come into a meadow.  As you look out into the meadow, on your right there is a lone tree standing. Use the lone tree as a marker.  Go west north-west across the meadow so that you travel 50 yards or so south (to the left) of the tree.  Go straight west at this point, until you reach another barbed wire fence.  When you cross this fence, there is another open meadow in front of you. Look west. There is a wall of timber beyond the meadow. The line of timber beyond the meadow ends in front of you, or perhaps, slightly to your right as you face west.  Look to the right of the end of the timber line and towards the horizon.  You will see a small grove of cedars in the distance.  (At this point, the cedars are too far away to be seen very clearly).  There is a larger grove of trees in the western distance to the right, but that grove is not completely made up on cedars, there are some other kinds of trees, oaks, etc. in that grove.  Keep your eyes on the small cedar grove.  Walk across the meadow toward the cedars.  After you cross the meadow, you will be walking up a slight incline.  When you reach the top of the hill, the cedar grove will be obvious, and that is Graveyard Hill.",Local history notes; TxHistCems website; Fannin Co Cemetery Association; DAR,"3395-332, 3396-441",True,True,,Fannin,74,,,,,,False,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4628

Continue on CR 490 past CR 1425 (4 way intersection and blinking light) approximately 1.5 miles from the 490/1425 intersections. The CR going north/south off of CR 490 are mostly marked, and most are caliche roads. The road to turn south on to reach Chavez #1 is not marked with a CR sign (guessing by other signs the road should be CR 105), but is marked with a small sign with green printing “Chavez Cemetery”. Turn south on this road for 1.1 miles and the cemetery will be on the east side.","Usgennet; Rootsweb; theyspeak; TxDot map 1997; USGS;
